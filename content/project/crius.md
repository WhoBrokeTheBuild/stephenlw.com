A SuiA custom server for HTTP, FTP, SMTP/POP/IMAP, and SQL, including a custom language for Websites.
The goal of this project was to better understand the different protocols and inner workings of
the services we use every day. The project was originally in C++ utilizing the Asio library, and
later rewritten in C. The aim was to create functional, but not perfect servers for the various
services, that properly used worker threads and multithreading programming practices.
