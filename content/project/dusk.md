A series of game/simulation engines written in C++ and C. These projects are part of my
ongoing attempts to create a good development library/engine for game and simulation
programming. Versions have been built on OpenGL and previously SFML/SDL. The most recent
version is written in C, utilizes the GLMM framework I wrote, and is focused on 3D.
