### Personal Projects / Experience

Created a MMORPG built on C/C++ and Unreal Engine 4 for my College Capstone Project. The servers were CentOS 7 with custom software. The protocols were built using Flatbuffers and Asio. The server architecture was designed around dockerized containers. The data was backed by a redis/MySQL pair handling all login, chat, and player game data.

Created a suite of web-related server software in C++ with Asio, named [Coeus](http://github.com/whobrokethebuild/Coeus), in order to better understand the underlying protocols. Includes HTTP, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP4, SQL, and a scripting language named CSL.

Created an Operating System named [ArcOS](http://github.com/whobrokethebuild/ArcOS) in x86 ASM which implemented several commands in 16bit real-mode.

Created several iterations of a C++ library / game engine originally called [Arc](http://github.com/whobrokethebuild/Arc-2.0) and later named [Dusk](http://github.com/whobrokethebuild/Dusk). Integrated with OpenGL and Lua as well as including a host of helper functions and classes, with a large focus on performance.

Created a Hugo-like static-site generator in Go named [GoingUp](http://github.com/whobrokethebuild/GoingUp) that uses Markdown for content.
