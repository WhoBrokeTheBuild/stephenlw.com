Have you ever had to deal with conflicting requirements from a client?

Ever had to make something work even though it directly contradicted what they
already asked for?

Introducing Quantum Git!

It's as easy to use as git, with the added bonus of storing the git commit log
in the quantum realm, allowing you to give your client both the things they
asked for at the same time, maybe.

    qgit add -A
    qgit commit -a "Adding the feature they wanted... maybe"
